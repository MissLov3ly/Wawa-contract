## üèÅ OverView

Wawa is an NFT collection like no other, with NFTs generated based on crypto community members' wallet activity.
Internet identities come to life as unique and hyper-cute characters, with each attribute determined by on-chain
histories. From top to toe, users' crypto histories become the DNA of their pixel-perfect, playable avatars. Every Wawa
comes complete with its very own pet, generated based on actions, such as trading on Uniswap.
